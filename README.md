[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

want to learn python and give back to home assistant
I have a lot of sensor that tell me the battery level % used


![battery](https://github.com/MYLE-01/battery_replacement/blob/master/battery_level.PNG)

so as I know the date I replace the battery ( 01/02/2020 ) dd/mm/yy   Dimmer Switch Battery Level

so between 01/02/2020 and now 03/07/2020 it has used 20% 

so my logic is  for 153 day its used 20%  

so (.20/153) = 0.0013 battery per day
